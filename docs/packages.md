# Packages

Every third-party program of the system is a package. A package has one
description file, `packages/<name>.toml`, and the shell image is built from
the list of these files. This is the build-time half of the packages of the
phone OS: the format and the data are in place, and installing into a
running system belongs to subproject 5.

## Format

A description holds strings and lists of strings, one `key = value` each
(the subset of TOML that Rust's xtask and Python's `tomllib` both read).
Unknown keys are refused.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The package name; equals the file name. |
| `version` | The pinned version of the source. |
| `kind` | `base` for the base set of the system, `addon` for the rest. A base package depends on base packages only. |
| `url` | The https URL of the source archive. |
| `sha256` | SHA-256 of the archive, 64 lowercase hex digits. |
| `license` | SPDX expression of the licence. |
| `depends` | Names of the packages it needs (nano and htop need ncurses). |
| `build` | The build script, from the workspace root. |
| `program` | The image program its build links, if it has one of its own. |
| `dirs` | Directories only this package needs. |
| `files` | `"<path in the image> = <source>"`, where the source is `elf:<program>`, `terminfo:<entry>`, `bytes:<name>` or `link:<name>`, a symbolic link to a file of its own directory (`/bin/cat = link:busybox`: `ls -l` shows `cat -> busybox`). Several paths may name one program (hard links), and the links to one name share one file of the image. A link must name a file of the image that is no link itself. |
| `license_file` | Optional: the licence file in the source tree, for tools that read it. |

Example (`packages/nano.toml`):

```toml
name = "nano"
version = "9.2"
kind = "addon"
url = "https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/nano/nano-9.2.tar.xz"
sha256 = "05ecb99247b782e8a5b3a25ed4101dd034b0236902f7449bc9795b717642f7e9"
license = "GPL-3.0-or-later"
depends = ["busybox", "ncurses"]
build = "tools/build-nano.py"
program = "nano"
files = [
  "/bin/nano = elf:nano",
]
```

The description is the one place for the version, URL and SHA-256. The
scripts of `tools/` read them through `tools/pkgdesc.py`, and xtask reads
them for the licence notes of the image.

## What xtask does

- The shell image (`boot-ash-dialog.img`) holds the base set and the add-ons.
  Its files and its programs come from the descriptions. The probe images list
  the few files they use and hold no package, so they get no add-on.
- `cargo xtask packages` checks the descriptions: a missing SHA-256, licence,
  version, URL or build script, a package without files, a file that two
  packages claim, an unknown dependency or a dependency cycle each stop it.
  It also checks that every file of the shell image belongs to exactly one
  package or to the base system (init and the services: `SYSTEM_PATHS` in
  `xtask/src/rootfs.rs`), and that every link names a file of its directory
  in the image. `/bin` holds the programs of the packages; the RAM service
  and the test program `login-probe` are in `/libexec`. `cargo xtask ci` runs this check first.
- `cargo xtask packages table` builds the image and prints a table with the
  name, version, licence, kind, number of files and bytes of each package.
  A program that several paths name counts once, for the first package that
  names it, so the packages linked into BusyBox (sbase, toybox, ncompress)
  show 0 bytes (their names are links to `busybox`). `cargo xtask ash-dialog` prints the same table.
- The build scripts of the packages run in build order: base first, each
  package after its dependencies.

## Add a package

1. Write the build script in `tools/`, with the version, URL and SHA-256 taken
   from `tools/pkgdesc.py` (`pkgdesc.load("<name>")`).
2. Write `packages/<name>.toml` with the keys above.
3. If the package has a program of its own, add its build (stack size and
   features) to `PACKAGE_PROGRAMS` in `xtask/src/main.rs`.
4. Run `cargo xtask packages`, then `cargo xtask packages table`.

## What stays for subproject 5

Installing and removing packages in a running system, the package file
format, signatures and trust in sources, the store and delivery (in the image,
from a disk, over the network), dependency resolution at install time, and
the sandbox and quotas of an application. Nothing here changes the quotas of
the image.
